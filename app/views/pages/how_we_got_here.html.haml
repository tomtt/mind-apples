  How we got here

%p
  Mindapples started as a social project in 2008 to encourage everyone to take better care of their minds. Our initial goal was to crowdsource answers to the question “What’s the five-a-day for your mind?” We created a simple blog and survey page and began asking people what five things they did to look after their minds. 

%p
  The project evolved organically, first into a series of pop-up events and then a fully-fledged social enterprise. With sponsorship from Courvoisier and a small grant from UntLtd and the Nominet Trust in 2010, we built a website and developed the online campaign into engagement tools and offline installations, taking our large wooden tree sculpture to music festivals, communities and universities.

%p
  Now our 5-a-day campaign has harvested over 50,000 mindapples, attracted national press coverage and gathered a lot of wonderful supporters. Mindapples continues to grow as an organisation too, securing ongoing support from Kings Health Partners and working with many prestigious clients including JP Morgan, L’Oreal, Roche, Centrica, SAB Miller, Mind and the Royal College of Physicians. 
  
%p
  The Mindapples journey started out back in early 2008 with an idle question that I put to my friends Dougald and Anna. My friend Jo Worsley and I were frustrated at how negative and pathologising the "mental health" debate seemed to be, particularly in the workplace, and also fearful of the potential damage this can do to people's self-esteem and civil liberties. After a seemingly unrelated chat with my friend Paul about the five-a-day campaign, I found myself saying: "I want to know what the mental health equivalent is of the five-a-day campaign."  And the idea just stuck. So here we are. But since I'm secretly a historian by nature, I'm going to use this page to keep track of the development of the project so that once we're all rich and famous, you can see how we got here.

  The idea of a "5-a-day for your mind" campaign emerges from conversations about preventative mental health care, the original 5-a-day campaign, and using the web to tackle social issues. I register mindapples.org and stayingsane.org, but prefer the former! :-) 
  On 29th February 2008, <a title="Mindapples on Social Innovation Camp" href="http://blog.mindapples.org/2012/02/29/happy-4th-birthday-mindapples/">I submit the idea to Social Innovation Camp</a>.
