  About Mindapples

    Mindapples encourages and supports people from all backgrounds to look after their minds. We encourage people to take better care of themselves through our

    and offer
    = link_to('training', training_path)
    to teach people how their minds work and improve their resilience and mental performance. We want to make looking after our minds as natural as brushing our teeth, by asking everyone, &#8220;What's the 5-a-day for your mind?&#8221;

  is down to our &#8220;outlook and activities&#8221; - the choices we make, the actions we take - and yet we know almost nothing about how to take care of ourselves. If we all knew a little more about how our minds work and what we can do to take care of them, we could maintain our health, and maybe live and work a little better too. So if we can brush our teeth, go to the gym and eat our 5-a-day, what about our minds?

  We want to know what works for you. We&#8217;re asking everyone to pick their own five &#8220;mindapples&#8221; and share them with the world, and using the power of the web to build a community of people taking care of their minds. So far we have harvested over 50,000 mindapples, attracted

    “I find Mindapples a pretty intriguing concept, which could really catch on. Just as gyms became a big thing in the 80s, will the 2010s see the arrival of serious preventative mental health?”
