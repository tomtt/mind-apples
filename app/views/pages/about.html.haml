  Mindapples helps everyone take care of our minds the way we take care of our bodies. We believe looking after our minds should be as natural as brushing our teeth, and if we do that, then everything will change - how we teach our children, how we run our businesses, how we deliver healthcare, and even how we design our society.

  What we do really does make a difference. Basic activities like sleep, water and exercise can improve mood and reduce the risk of ill-health%i
  %i
    (e.g. Sleep Matters, Mental Health Foundation, 2011; Fox, 1999; Armstrong, Ganio et al, 2012), 
  whilst integrating 'breathers' and 'restorers' into our daily lives can help us maintain our mental wellbeing and prevent future health problems 
  %i
    (Pressman et al, 2009; Jansen & von Sadovszky, 2004). 
  Just as in healthy eating or smoking prevention, we need to build a popular culture of awareness and self-care about our minds. So, if we can brush our teeth, go to the gym and eat our 5-a-day, what can we do for our minds?

    “I find Mindapples a pretty intriguing concept, which could really catch on. Just as gyms became a big thing in the 80s, will the 2010s see the arrival of serious preventative mental health?”

  Mindapples started in 2008, asking everyone to share what they do to look after their minds. Our continuing goal is to normalise the conversation about mental health and make it relevant and enjoyable for everyone. We do this at scale now, all around the UK and beyond, asking people to share the ‘5-a-day' for their minds online, at events and pop-ups, and through other organisations via our

  We offer a
