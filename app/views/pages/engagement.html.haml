    Raising awareness of mental wellbeing and getting people talking and learning about their minds. 
  
%p
  The business case for promoting mental wellbeing is obvious. Recent studies have shown that staff are 12% more productive when in a positive mental state 
  %i
    (University of Warwick, 2010),
  increasing employee wellbeing can increase sales by up to 9 per cent 
  %i
    (IJSIM 14, 2003)
  and staff wellbeing and engagement programmes are showing a return on investment of 9:1 in the first year alone 
  %i
    (AJHP 22, 2007). It's time for businesses to take positive action to develop the mental resources of their staff.

%p
  All our engagement starts with the question: 
  %i
    "what's the 5-a-day for your mind?"
  By asking people what they do already, we put people in control and give them responsibility for their own health. We've used this approach successfully in all kinds of situations, including the corporate vents, festivals, universities, schools and community events, and are tailored to suit a range of budgets.

    "Mindapples and its simple but effective concept of five a day is a great platform for sharing ideas and challenges us to help ourselves while taking control of our mental attitude and health."

  The Mindapples Tree

%p
  The Mindapples Tree is an eye-catching way to get people talking about their minds. The sculpture asks people to write the '5-a-day' for their minds on apple-shaped cards and hang them on the tree for others to see, sparking conversations and giving participants the chance to share tips with each other. The tree has been used successfully in multinational businesses, corporate conferences, music festivals, street markets and even in art galleries, and it's guaranteed to make a big impact.

  We can also design wellness events to engage people in managing their wellbeing. We've worked with big brands like Crussh, Headspace and Courvoisier to run major public events, most famously <a href="/thebigtreat">The Big Treat</a>, a pop-up health farm of amazing ways to treat yourself better, which received media coverage from View London and Urban Junkies.

  Keynote talks

  Founder and 'Head Gardener' Andy Gibson is a popular public speaker who has given keynote talks at some of the biggest businesses in the world. Our keynote talks introduce people to the wonder of their minds and relate this to the business. They work well for launching programmes, introducing training or simply giving your people a lift.
  
%p
  Our current keynote topics include:
  %ul
    %li Meet your mind: a 45-minute introduction to your mind at work, how to look after it, and why this vital subject matters for businesses.
