      Research

    %p
      As Mindapples grows, we are slowly building out our research programme to learn more about the need for Mindapples and how our services can benefit people around the UK. 
      
    %p
      Our research programme is currently focussing on the following areas: 
      %ul
        %li collating evidence about the social need for Mindapples and our particular approach shifting attitudes and behaviours
        %li benchmarking attitudes to and knowledge of mental health in the UK
        %li collecting evidence about the efficacy and impact of our engagement and training services
        %li understanding the psychology of our "5-a-day for your mind" question, and how the responses can be interpreted

    %p
      You can help us right now by taking our 
      = link_to('national attitudes survey', survey_path)
      and telling us what you think about mental health.
        
    %p
      We're happy to share what we know, and we're also keen to learn from the research of others, so if you're a researcher or wellbeing organisation and you want to chat to us,
      = link_to('write to us here', 'mailto:hello@mindapples.org') + "."
