  Terms and Conditions

%p
  %i
    We're sorry these terms aren't friendlier. We've done our best to tick all the necessary legal boxes, whilst also not taking away any unnecessary rights of our users. Some bits also seem to be in CAPITALS. If we've got anything wrong, or spelt something particularly badly, please let us know. It's the only way we'll learn.

%p    
  The following terms apply mainly to this website (www.mindapples.org) but are also referenced as the standard terms for all our other digital products and services, including mobile apps and other websites.
  
%h2
  1. INTRODUCTION

%p
  1.1 In these Terms and Conditions "we", "us" and "our" mean Mindapples as defined below and "you" and "your" mean the Member (acting in their own personal capacity, or on behalf of an organisation, as the context requires).
